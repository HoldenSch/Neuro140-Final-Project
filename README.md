Mario Level Generation with GANs:
This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate playable and stylistically consistent Super Mario Bros-style platformer levels. By training on real Mario level data, the model learns implicit design patterns and produces new level segments with a balance of diversity and structure.
